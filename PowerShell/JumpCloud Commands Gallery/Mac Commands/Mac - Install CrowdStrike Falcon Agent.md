#### Description

This command will download and install the CrowdStrike Falcon Agent to the device if it isn't already installed. The command will leverage CrowdStrike's API to find and download the latest version of the Falcon Agent onto the local machine.

In order to use this command, follow the instructions from the [Installing the CrowdStrike Falcon Agent KB](https://support.jumpcloud.com/s/article/Installing-the-Crowdstrike-Falcon-Agent)

Specifically for this command:

1. Create a CrowdStrike API Client with the "SENSOR DOWNLOAD" Read scope and make note of the ClientID and ClientSecret. Refer to CrowdStrike's article [Getting Access to the CrowdStrike API](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/tech-center/get-access-falcon-apis/) for further information
2. Set the 3 variables (CSBaseAddress, CSClientID, CSClientSecret) to their respective values for your CrowdStrike API Client
3. Extend the command timeout to a value that makes sense in your environment. The suggested command timeout for an environment with average network speeds on devices with average computing power is 10 minutes. Note that the command may timeout with a 124 error code in the command result window if not extended, but the script will continue to run.
